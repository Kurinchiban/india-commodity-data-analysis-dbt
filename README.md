dbt lets you write modular SQL SELECT statements (called models), which it then compiles and runs in your data warehouse. Think of it as the "T" in ELT â€” dbt is built specifically for transforming raw data that's already been loaded into your data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc.).
